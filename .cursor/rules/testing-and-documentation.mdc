Unit Testing:

Write unit tests for critical functions (e.g., DV01 calculations, rolling feature generation) in a tests/ directory using pytest.

Ensure tests cover edge cases (e.g., handling missing data, very short rolling windows).

Documentation:

Maintain a detailed README.md that explains the projectâ€™s motivation, data sources, methodology, and instructions for running the code.

Update documentation when significant changes are made to the codebase.

Include a CONTRIBUTING.md file (this document) with guidelines for future collaborators.

Document any assumptions (e.g., how DV01 is approximated, chosen thresholds for classification, etc.) directly in the code or in a separate documentation file.
