Language and Style:

Use Python 3.8+ and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.

Use meaningful variable and function names (e.g., yield_spread_2s10s, compute_rolling_volatility()).

Include docstrings for all functions and classes, describing inputs, outputs, and purpose.

Write inline comments to explain non-obvious logic, especially in financial calculations (like DV01 computations).

Modularization:

Break functionality into small, reusable functions.

Avoid duplication by reusing utility functions from utils.py or metrics.py.

Error Handling:

Use try/except blocks where external data is fetched to handle API failures gracefully.

Validate data (check for missing or out-of-range values) and log errors for debugging.

Reproducibility:

Set random seeds at the beginning of each training routine (for numpy, random, TensorFlow/PyTorch, etc.).

Ensure data preprocessing uses only past data (no lookahead bias) by using proper shifting and windowing functions.
