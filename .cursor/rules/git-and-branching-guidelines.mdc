Branching Model:

Use a standard branching model (e.g., main/master for stable code, develop for active development).

Create feature branches for new modules or significant changes (e.g., feature/shap-analysis).

Commit Messages:

Use clear, descriptive commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., “Add function to compute DV01-neutral hedge ratio” or “Fix data alignment bug in feature engineering”).

Reference issues or tickets if you’re using an issue tracker.

Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

Open pull requests for merging feature branches into the develop branch.

Ensure that code is reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.

Include a brief description of changes and how they were tested.
