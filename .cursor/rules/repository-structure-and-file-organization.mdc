data/

raw/: Store original downloaded data (CSV, pickle files).

processed/: Store cleaned and processed datasets (features, targets).

external/: (Optional) Store additional data sources if needed.

notebooks/

Use numbered notebooks (e.g., 1_data_collection.ipynb, 2_feature_engineering.ipynb, etc.) to guide readers step-by-step.

src/

data_ingestion.py: Functions to fetch and update data from FRED or other sources.

feature_engineering.py: Functions to calculate spreads, rolling features, macro integration, and to generate targets.
