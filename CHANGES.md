### Feature Analysis Structure Documentation

#### Analysis Organization
- Documented complete structure of feature analysis results
- Clarified different prediction strategies for each spread:
  - Next Day (∆Spread): Precise numerical prediction for trade sizing
  - Direction (+1/-1): Binary classification for directional trading
  - Ternary: Classification for significant moves (strong up/neutral/strong down)

#### Spread-Specific Analysis
- Detailed analysis for each Treasury spread:
  - 2s10s (2-year vs 10-year)
  - 5s30s (5-year vs 30-year)
  - 2s5s (2-year vs 5-year)
  - 10s30s (10-year vs 30-year)
  - 3m10y (3-month vs 10-year)

#### Feature Selection Results
- Documented feature selection process for each spread and strategy
- Recorded number of selected features:
  - Next Day: ~85-88 features
  - Direction: ~85-88 features
  - Ternary: ~21 features
- Identified key features for each prediction type

### 16:50 EDT
- Enhanced data cleaning process in data_ingestion.py:
  - Removed max_fill limit for forward filling
  - Implemented zero-filling before first valid data point to prevent forward bias
  - Added unlimited forward fill after first valid point until next data update
  - Improved data quality logging with detailed statistics
  - Added tracking of first non-zero values for each series
  - Maintained business day filtering for trading data

### 16:30 EDT - Enhanced Data Ingestion Module
- Expanded Treasury yield data collection:
  - Added short-term yields (3M, 6M, 1Y)
  - Added medium-term yields (2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y)
  - Added long-term yields (10Y, 20Y, 30Y)
  - Implemented key spread calculations:
    - 2s10s Spread
    - 5s30s Spread
    - 3m10y Spread
    - 2s5s Spread
    - 10s30s Spread
- Enhanced macro indicators coverage:
  - Interest Rates and Monetary Policy (Fed Funds, RRP, Balance Sheet)
  - Inflation Metrics (CPI, PCE, Breakeven rates)
  - Credit Spreads (Corporate bonds, CMBS)
  - Economic Indicators (Employment, GDP, Production)
  - Money Supply and Bank Credit
  - Market Indicators (S&P 500, VIX, Commodities)
  - Volatility and Risk Measures (Various VIX indices)
  - Bond Market Indicators (Treasury spreads)
  - Market Liquidity Measures (TED Spread)
  - Business Cycle Indicators (PMIs, Leading Index)
- Improved data organization and logging
- Removed duplicate entries from macro indicators

### 15:30 EDT - Initial Data Ingestion Implementation
- Created `src/data_ingestion.py` module
- Implemented FRED API integration
- Set up basic Treasury yield data collection
- Added initial macro indicators
- Implemented data saving functionality
- Added logging system
- Set up secure API key management

### 15:34 EDT
- Fixed data ingestion issues by removing problematic FRED series:
  - Removed Gold Price series due to API availability issues

  - All remaining series now fetch successfully

### 15:37 EDT
- Updated data ingestion module:
  - Set default start date to January 1, 2010 for all data
  - Added rounding to 4 decimal places for all numeric values
  - Successfully fetching all available data with no errors

### 14:47 EDT - Directory Structure Setup

  ├── raw/
  ├── processed/
  └── external/
  ```
- Created results directory structure:
  ```
  results/
  ├── model_pickles/
  ├── plots/
  ├── performance_reports/
  └── logs/
