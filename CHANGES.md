### 10s30s Ternary Classification Investigation

#### Issue Analysis
1. Target Distribution:
   - All 3,980 samples labeled as class 0
   - No samples in classes 1 or 2
   - Complete class imbalance preventing meaningful classification

2. Root Cause:
   - Ternary classification thresholds too strict for 10s30s spread
   - Spread-specific volatility characteristics not considered
   - Static thresholds not suitable for all spreads

3. Impact:
   - Zero features selected for classification
   - No meaningful patterns found in feature importance
   - Very low mutual information scores (<0.03)

#### Recommended Solutions
1. Threshold Adjustment:
   - Implement spread-specific thresholds
   - Use historical volatility for threshold determination
   - Consider dynamic thresholding based on rolling statistics

2. Alternative Approaches:
   - Use different classification strategy for 10s30s
   - Implement adaptive thresholding
   - Consider regression-based approach instead

## 2024-04-06 23:30 EDT

### 10s30s Ternary Classification Investigation Postponed

#### Decision
- Temporarily postponing investigation of 10s30s ternary classification issue

- Will revisit the issue during model development phase

#### Current Status
- 10s30s spread will use only next-day and direction predictions
- Ternary classification temporarily disabled for 10s30s
- Other spreads continue with all three prediction types

#### Future Plans
- Revisit ternary classification during model development
- Consider alternative approaches for 10s30s spread
- Implement spread-specific thresholding when needed
