## Current Status (2024-04-06 16:50 EDT)

### Data Ingestion Module
- ✅ Implemented FRED API connection with error handling
- ✅ Added comprehensive Treasury yield data collection (3M to 30Y)
- ✅ Added key spread calculations (2s10s, 5s30s, 3m10y, 2s5s, 10s30s)
- ✅ Implemented extensive macro indicator collection across categories:
  - Interest Rates and Monetary Policy
  - Inflation Metrics
  - Credit Spreads
  - Economic Indicators
  - Money Supply and Bank Credit
  - Market Indicators
  - Volatility and Risk Measures
