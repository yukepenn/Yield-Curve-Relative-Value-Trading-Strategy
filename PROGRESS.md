  - Added medium-term yields (2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y)
  - Added long-term yields (10Y, 20Y, 30Y)
  - Implemented key spread calculations (2s10s, 5s30s, 3m10y, 2s5s, 10s30s)
- Added comprehensive macro indicators:
  - Interest Rates and Monetary Policy
  - Inflation Metrics
  - Credit Spreads
  - Economic Indicators
  - Money Supply and Bank Credit
  - Market Indicators
  - Volatility and Risk Measures
  - Bond Market Indicators
  - Market Liquidity Measures
  - Business Cycle Indicators

## Current Status (2024-04-06 18:00 EDT)

### Code Structure and Organization
- ✅ Reorganized project structure:
  - Proper package setup with __init__.py files
  - Tests moved to dedicated tests/ directory
  - Improved path handling for cross-platform compatibility
  - Clear separation of source code and tests

### Data Ingestion Module
- ✅ Implemented FRED API connection with error handling
- ✅ Added comprehensive Treasury yield data collection (3M to 30Y)
- ✅ Added key spread calculations (2s10s, 5s30s, 3m10y, 2s5s, 10s30s)
- ✅ Implemented extensive macro indicator collection
- ✅ Enhanced data cleaning process with proper forward fill

### Feature Engineering Module
- ✅ Optimized feature set (166 non-redundant features)
- ✅ Improved feature computation efficiency
- ✅ Resolved all deprecation warnings
- ✅ Maintained 15 target variables
- ✅ Clean train/validation/test splits

### Next Steps
1. Add feature importance analysis
2. Begin model development phase:
   - Design model architecture
